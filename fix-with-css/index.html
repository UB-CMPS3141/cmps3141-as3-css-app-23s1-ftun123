	<h1>Learnability</h1>
	<p>When a users hovers over a button and it changes appearance (the backgroung color) it provides visual
	   feedback to the user. This feedback is a way of teaching or informing the user that the button is interactive.
	   The hover effect helps users learn that the button is clickable, enhancing the overall learnability of the users
	   interface
	</p>

	user doesnt know if he can click it or not. To the left is a picture of the login button. A hover selector can 
	be added so that when the user hovers over the login button the login button changes to another color. To the right 
	is the picture of the login button with the selector added.

<h1>Efficiency</h1>
	<p>When users are searching for information, they want to visit sites that are clear to understand so 
	   the page needs to be clear, organized, and links or buttons have to allow users to move through the 
	   interface effortlessly. It shoudld also have consistency including layout,color schemes, which should help the
	   user predict how to interact with the system. 
	</p>

	<p>On the Public Service site for Belize  
	<a href="https://www.publicservice.gov.bz/index.php/2015-12-04-22-38-57/ministries-and-departments"
    target="_blank">Public Service Site of Belize</a> the table that is displayed first is not 
	clear to understand and the users would loose valuable time to get what they need from the site. First the white rows
	dont show the edges of the table so it doesnt look like a table. Secondly the columns of the table are not separated 
	so it can confuse the user as to which information is for which column. Thirdly, the text of the color on the table 
	is the same as some rows. Lastly, the links as we remember most of them are with blue text but the ones on this site
	are with green. I overrode css rules so the user could go into the site and get what he wants which in this case would
	be to visist the website of the governement branch they are looking for without having delays due to the poor layout,
    color schemes, link, and unclear information. This is the second picture.

<h1>Safety</h1>
	<p>Regarding safety we want the user to access a website where there is error prevention, 
	   the user can undo actions done, provide error messages, and let the user have control and freedom 
	   over the website. They shouldn't be afraid of using the wesbite. 
	</p>

	<p>On the Hackers News Website 
	<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newest"
    target="_blank">Hackers News Website</a> the navigation bar's links are too congested which can cause 
	                the user to click something that he didnt want to click. The words are too small so the user 
					can click on a word thinking that it's something else. Lastly, there is no mouse hover in the
					navigation bar and the user would have to click the link more than once to get re-directed. 
					These issues dont allow the user to have control and freedom over the website. You can take a look
					at the first picture below to identify these problems as well. As a solution I added border spacing, 
					increased the font size, underlined hyperlinks, and added a mouse over to the links in the navigarion
					bar. I also set a border around the links in the navigation bar so we can notice the navigation bar 
					itself. The picture with the improvements is the second one below.
