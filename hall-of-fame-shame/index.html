   <!-- Section 2: What I Like (non-safety aspects) -->
   <section>
     <h2>I Like...</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>That as you click go it starts to measure your download/upload mbps and no matter how much 
            times you press go it never stays on loading it will always give you a result.
       </li>
       <li>That as you hover over the navigation menu options the hover effect is seen and not only that 
           but the user doesnt have to click any options for the drop down menu to appear because as you hover over 
           the option a drop down menu automatically appears.
       </li>
       <li>That the website is direct to the point, meaning if you want to test your internet's speed you can do it
           without drawbacks, you just click "go" and it starts testing your internet's speed without any additonal steps
           to test your speed and the result is clear without any extra information that is not needed or necessary.
       </li>

   <!-- Section 3: What I Wish (safety improvements) -->
   <section>
     <h2>I Wish...</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>There were less adds</li>
       <li>There was a return button if you click one of the drop down menu options</li>
       <li>There weren't any repeating links, for example in apps on the navigation bar menu it has links to download
           the speed test app on different devices, but the same thing is repeated at the bottom of the main page so 
           the user would be curious if its the same thing or not and would probably try to find out and it could end
          in being a fatal error.
       </li>
       <li>Prompt messages to the users if they are sure they want to visit certian links.</li>
     </ul>

   <!-- Section 4: What If (ideas for safety improvements) -->
   <section>
     <h2>What If...</h2>
     <p>To improve safety on this website:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>The website wouldn't display any adds or instead of displaying like 5 ads only 
           it only displays 1 where its not close to relevant information about internet's speed.
       </li>
       <li>The same information is not repeated twice like if the user wants to download the speed test app
           on a device display that info on the main page only or display it on another subpage making the informatiion
           clear to the user instead of confusing him.
       </li>
       <li>Provide security tips and resources for users when clicking links</li>
     </ul>
