</head>
<body>
    <h2>User Interface:</h2>
    <p><strong>Spreadsheet:</strong> Spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets offer a grid-based interface where you input data into cells. They are primarily designed for numeric and tabular data.</p>
    <p><strong>Expense Manager App:</strong> The app provides a more user-friendly and tailored interface for managing expenses. It includes input fields for expense details (title, amount, payer, payee, date, currency) and displays data in tables, making it easier to input and visualize expense data.</p>

    <h2>Data Entry:</h2>
    <p><strong>Spreadsheet:</strong> Data entry in spreadsheets can be manual and requires you to type or copy-paste data into cells. Formulas and functions can automate some calculations.</p>
    <p><strong>Expense Manager App:</strong> The app provides structured forms for entering expense data, reducing the chance of input errors. It also include features for currency conversion and automatic calculations.</p>

    <h2>Data Security:</h2>
    <p><strong>Spreadsheet:</strong> Spreadsheets are often saved on local devices, raising concerns about data loss.</p>
    <p><strong>Expense Manager App:</strong> Users are responsible for regular backups to prevent data loss. Sharing: Sharing can be done, but there are security concerns related to data access.</p>
